# AI_DESKTOP_ASSISTANT-
AI DESKTOP ASSISTANT FOR THE DISABLED 

It is said that “Technology is only useful if it is accessible to any user.”
A lot of technologies can be out of reach for the disabled because most features 
can’t assist to them or they are unable to use it due to their disabilities.
Keeping this in mind, this project focuses to build a software tool for the 
disabled community.
It is an AI assistant that can perform various functions on the desktop 
depending on the disability.
I focused more on people who don’t have hands and can use this assistant to 
carry minor tasks on the computer

# WHAT CAN MY ASSISTANT DO?
IMPLEMENTATION-

• say(text)-
This function converts any text entered by the user into speech. So, the 
people who are not able to speak can use this functionality as the text they 
enter will be spoken by the computer.

• take_command ()-
This function will recognize what you speak and convert that speech into 
text. This function is very useful. Every other task that the assistant will 
perform will be based on the command given by the user. So, the people 
who don’t have hands or eyes to use the hardware properly can use this 
functionality.

• close_application(app_name)-
This function helps to manually close any running application on the system 
by just saying the word “CLOSE”.

• send_email (subject, body, to-email)-
This function is used to send an email to a particular recipient just by using 
your voice.

• get_weather(api_key)-
This function gives the weather report of any particular city entered by the 
user.

calling out their names.

• This assistant can also open various applications installed on our 
computer like Outlook and MS Word.

• You can prompt the assistant anytime to tell you the time right now.

This assistant can also play music and change it using voice control.
